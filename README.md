APP: Step Competition

Description: Using apples health kit, the step competition app gains access to users steps and saves them to their unique user account. A user can start a new step competition
but if a user creates an account after the competition starts they cannot join until the new one is over. The app uses an api call to "https://cataas.com/cat" and calls a random async
image as motivation! 

This app has business use cases such as insurance company's wanting to incentivise and gamify activity to its customers. It also can simply be a fun little app to play against your friends
and collect different rewards and cats.

Special techniques used: Firebase firestore and authorization, Health Kit, Charts, health data, privacy authorization, MVVM's, API calls, Async images, custom structs and classes, 
different variables stored with each user, etc.
